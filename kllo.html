                    <p>kllo. is a clothing brand that <b>exudes the ideas/concepts of </b> or custom itineraries. Imagine travelling to a new city and being able to meet local people that are eager to share their culture and stories with you.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p><b>Problem</b>: Travellers have to know somebody local, book a tour guide, or be lucky enough to bump into a local that offers to show them around in order to fully experience a new place they're visiting.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p><b>Solution</b>: Loco bridges the gap between travellers and locals so that they can truly understand the culture and places they visit opposed to only seeing tourist spots created and moulded for them.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>This is an individual school project that involves app analyses, user flow, wireframes, visual mocks, prototypes (Marvel/Origami), and an app website completed in 12 weeks. Thank you to the Facebook design team (Andy Chung, Vivian Wang, and Brandon Walkin) for partnering with my class for weekly critiques and support. </p>

                    <p>The primary goal of this app is to provide locals with an opportunity to share their culture and home to travellers while they benefit by seeing the genuine and real homesteads and culture, instead of tourist creations. An additional goal is to create relationships between locals and tourists from around the world, helping people connect with each other.</p>

                    <p>Loco isn’t a typical travel guide app where you can see recommendations and hotspots, but more so it focuses on the connection between the locals and travellers.</p>
