                    <p>Through the class IEOR 170: Human Factors and, I was given the chance to work with a great group to tackle an issue that was dear to our hearts: food sustainability and food accessibility in the Bay Area.  The project was intended to be a semester long [trek] and was culminated with a final prototype, a presentation poster and a video.  Throughout the semester, our team explored with many product solutions ranging from physical products to digital software solutions; ultimately our group decided that the best solution was to create a digital application.  Our design process required us to do user ethnography in the form of multiple interviews, and the creation of personas and user journey maps based on the observations from the aforementioned interviews.  The creation of the actual design solution was created using Sketch and prototyped using InVision.</p>

                    <p>After defining the purpose of our design, we sought to narrow the scope of our mission and figure out how we were actually going to tackle such a big problem as food sustainability/accessibility.  To do this, our team focused on performing secondary research to understand how others have attempted in solving this problem.  Additionally, our team conducted quick interviews with community members from Berkeley and Oakland to understand their feelings about their current access to sustainable foods.   From our research, we found 3 viable areas of design and compared their pros and cons:</p>

                    <p>After our group decided that community gardens were the best vehicle in solving food sustainability/accessibility in the Bay Area, we created pre- and post-intervention interview questions and performed interviews.  In our more thorough interviews, we looked for interviewees who were either strongly affected by food insecurity, passionate about food sustainability, experienced with their community garden, or were community garden managers themselves.  We compiled the observations from these interviews and indentified key insights that could aid us in creating a solution.  These oberservations and insights became the basis of our data analysis, and were key in the creation of our user personas and user journey.</p>

                    <p>In creating our user personas, we found that there were three main groups that utilized community gardens, each with different needs: garden managers, avid garden goers, average community members.</p>
