          </div>
          <div class="cs-text">
            <p>We began our project wanting to address the problem of food insecurity and sustainability in the United States. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food security as "access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life.” Food insecurity is an issue faced daily by us, our peers, and our neighbors due to a lack of price inclusive, nutritious foods. This motivated us to understand the topic more and come up with creative solutions to help alleviate this pressing problem.  Additionally, we wanted to be able to address food insecurity in a way that promoted food sustainability.  When buying groceries, most shoppers don't consider the carbon footprint associated with the produce.  Grocery store produce creates a large carbon footprint because of the amount of energy required to carry the produce from the farm to the store.</p>

            <p>For our user research we:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>performed <b><mark>secondary research</mark></b> focusing specifically on </li>
              <li>conducted <b><mark>interviews</mark></b> with residents of <b><mark>food insecure areas</mark></b></li>
              <li>created <b><mark>user personas</mark></b> and a <b><mark>user journey map</mark></b> based on the information gathered from user interviews</li>
            </ul>
            <p>From the secondary research, we utalized online resources to discover that the most accessible ways to increase food sustainability would be: <b><mark>indoor hydroponics</mark>, <mark>farmers markets</mark> and <mark>community gardens</mark></b>. We created a pros and cons chat that highlighted the sustainability and accessibility aspects of each solution.</p>
            
            <img src="images/WeGrow%20Design%20Oppos.png" class="img-fluid">
            
            <p>We set this data aside for the time being, then synthesized the results from our interviews.  From our interviews we were able to deduce three main insights:</p>
            
            <img src="images/WeGrow%20Insights.png" class="img-fluid">
            
            <p>After taking the insights from our interviews in account, we used our pros and cons chart to deduce that <b><mark>community gardens</mark></b> were the solution for our users; primarily because:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>they are <b>available</b> to most members of the community (but are not utilized due to lack of exposure)</li>
              <li>have an extremely <b><mark>low carbon foot print</mark></b></li>
              <li>have a <b><mark>low actual monetary cost</mark></b></li>
            </ul>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>With a new framework in mind, we conducted another set of interviews, this time specificially focusing on the users interactions with community gardens; we then broke down our users into three main groups (<b><mark>community garden manager</mark>, <mark>avid garden goers</mark> and <mark>average community members</mark></b>) and created user personas about them.</p>
            
            <img src="images/WeGrow%20Personas.png" class="img-fluid">
            
            <p>The personas allowed us to better empathize and understand who we are designing for.  Some aspects of our users that stood out to us were:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Avid garden goers</b> had a <b>difficult time navigating the garden</b> and felt that the <b>lack of organization</b> led to too much wasted time.</li>
              <li><b>Garden managers</b> became frustrated when overstocked produce was not harvested properly or not picked up, resulting in <b>excessive wasted produce</b></li>
              <li><b>Community members</b> want to be able to utilize the community garden, but either <b>don’t feel comfortable</b> or are <b>unaware of the logistics</b> surrounding the garden</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <p>Following our user personas, we created an <b>in-depth user journey</b> that followed the steps that the user would typically take on a trip to their community garden. We hoped that the mapped out user journey would allow us to see exactly where <b>users felt most stressed as well as what aspects of community gardens we could build up upon.</b></p>
            
            <img src="images/WeGrow%20User%20Journey.png" class="img-fluid">

            <p>Our user journey map was extremely helpful in pinpointing exactly which experiences could be approved upon.  We deduced that the primary sources of frustration faced by the community members were:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>a difficult time <b><mark>entering</mark>and <mark>engaging</mark></b>the community garden because of <b><mark>unfamiliarity </mark></b></li>
                <li>a <b><mark>messy task board</mark></b> made <b><mark>finding</mark></b> and <b><mark>executing</mark></b> tasks excessively difficult </li>
                <li>a <b><mark>cluttered event board</mark></b> resulted in <b><mark>community events</mark></b> being overlooked and <b><mark>difficult to attend </mark></b></li>
              </ul>

                <br>

              <p>Taking all our data into account, our team deduced 4 main user needs that we could use as a basis for our design solution:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li> &nbsp Increased <b>community engagement and outreach</b></li>
                  <li> &nbsp A more <b>connected information regarding produce stock</b></li>
                  <li> &nbsp A more <b>clarified task and event board</b></li>
                  <li> &nbsp A <b>learning center</b> for gardening skills</li>
                </ol>

            <b>Ideation</b>
          </div>
          <div class="cs-text">
            <p>For our ideation phase, we used the user needs as design opportunities to  discovered from our research to address pain points or design opportunities from our user journey, or reach the goals and alleviate the frustrations that we were stated in our user personas.</p>
		    <img src='images/WeGrow%20Design%20Oppor.png' class="img-fluid">	
            <p>At the conclusion of our ideation phase, we ended up with many separate solutions that would allow our users to better utalize their community, and in turn increase their food sustainability.  Our team decided that the next step would to be to create one solution that included all these separated ideas into a cohesive and easy to use design.  We tinkered around with different ideas of physical and digital products and decided that the most feasible designs would be:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>systems redesign</li>
              <li>concept app design</li>

            <div class="cs-subtitle">Systems Design</div>
              <div class="cs-text>">
                <p>The systems redesign of the community garden would put a larger focus on the community aspect of the garden. It would be more than just members picking up produce; the garden would be a hub of activity that excites the community to partake in the gardening.  To execute this, we suggested that:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the community managers plan more community events </li>
                  <li>managers spend time highlighting certain community members every week</li>
                  <li>the garden be restructured  into a grid based system that streamlines the process of finding produce</li>

              <div class="cs-text>">
                <p>A mobile app was the easiest way to implement core features that attended to user needs. A mobile app provides:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>an accessible medium for users to see what produce are available</li>
                  <li>the ability to see what task need to be completed in the garden</li>
                  <li>the capability to provide live time updates on vital information such as change in produce stocks, completion of tasks and upcoming events.

          </div>
          <div class="cs-text">
            <p>After deciding on creating a concept app design as our solution, we set out on creating wire frames and prototypes to create the most optimal user flow and interactions.</p>
            <div class="cs-subtitle">User Flow
            </div>
            <p>Within the concept app, we decided on a few necessary features and screens and mapped them out on a user flow chart.</p>
            
            <img src="images/WeGrow%20User%20Flow%20.png" class="img-fluid">
            
            <p>The deeply revised user flow chart provided a framework upon which we could:</p>
            
            <div class="cs-subtitle">Mid-Fidelity Prototypes</div>
            
            <p>Our goal with these midfidelity prototypes was to create a succient user flow that attempted to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>reduce the burden put on the individual with interacting with the app (having to fill our excessive information fields)</li>
                    <li>allowing users to complete their desired tasks in the quickest way possible (by reducing the amount of screens and clicks required to go from”point A to B”)</li>
                </ul>
            
            <div class="cs-subtitle">Picking Produce Prototype</div>

            <img src="images/WeGrow%20Picking%20Produce%201st%20Iteration.png" class="img-fluid">

            <p>After having non-group members test the prototype and receiving feedback, we realized that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the user flow was too tedious and unintuitive</li>
                    <li>selecting the area on the map before choosing the produce caused confusion and resulted in more of the user’s time being wasted</li>
                </ul>
            <br>
            <img src="images/WeGrow%20Picking%20Produce%202nd%20Iteration.png" class="img-fluid">
            <p>With the second iteration, the main flaws were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the design does not provide a clear indication of the produce status </li>
                    <li>users would have to view the produce main page to see this information</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our final iteration attempts to fix these issues through the use of a new layout and the implementation of color.</p>
                <br>
            <div class="cs-subtitle">Task/Event Scheduler</div>
            <img src="images/WeGrow%20Scheduler%20.png" class="img-fluid">
            <p>This user flow was very poorly received, with some core issues being:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>confusion on how to access tasks and view events</li>
                    <li>a lack of clear indication of things being active or inactive</li>
                    <li>he calendar taking too much space and not providing relevant information</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In our final design, we scrapped the calendar idea and focused on created a succinct task board.</p>

                <p>A key design choice for the app was to use an intuitive color scheme to help guide users through the app.  The implementation of a familiar “stop-light” color scheme allows users to easily understand the status of things without the need to see further text.  Within the task board feature, WeGrow uses the color scheme to convey the urgency of a certain task and to highlight the status of an event.  Within the picking produce feature, the color indicates the status and stock of a certain produce.</p>

                <p>The Task Board/Event Board tab consolidates all the tasks and events that are ongoing at the garden.  This centralized view of the garden tasks easily allows users to see what needs to be done at the garden and provides the ability to update what work has been done in the real time.  By clicking on a tasks, users can see more information about the task such as where it takes place, what skills and items are needed and when it needs to be completed.  Tasks are color coded to help users understand the level of urgency of the tasks: green means low-urgency, yellow moderate, and red urgent.  Additionally, users can view upcoming community events.  Events that have not been RSVP’d to are displayed as yellow; events that are marked as “going” are green, and red is used to indicate “not going”.</p>

            <p>Looking back at the work that I have completed with my group, I am extremely proud of our solution and would love to take further steps to implement it within the local community garden's within Berkeley.  Although not mentioned within the case study, and integral part of solution was a "manager facing" application that communicated with the "consumer facing" mobile app.  These ideas piqued the interest of the community garden managers and our group has considered developing the applications for practical use.  WeGrow seems like a first great step in increasing accessibility to sustainable foods, but unfortunately it is not the most scalable design solution. Going forward, I want to do more research and hopefully design a solution focused on providing large scale access to sustainable foods.  Some technologies and areas of research that I think are viable are: lab grown meats, farmer’s markets and community operated groceries.</p>
