                             <p>We began our project wanting to address the problem of food insecurity and sustainability in the United States. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food security as "access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life.” Food insecurity is an issue faced daily by us, our peers, and our neighbors due to a lack of price inclusive, nutritious foods. This motivated us to understand the topic more and come up with creative solutions to help alleviate this pressing problem.  Additionally, we wanted to be able to address food insecurity in a way that promoted food sustainability.  When buying groceries, most shoppers don't consider the carbon footprint associated with the produce.  Grocery store produce creates a large carbon footprint because of the amount of energy required to carry the produce from the farm to the store.</p>

                        <li>they are <b>available</b> to most members of the community (but are not utilized due to lack of exposure)</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Avid garden goers had a difficult time navigating the garden and felt that the lack of organization led to too much wasted time.</li>
                        <li>Garden managers became frustrated when overstocked produce was not harvested properly or not picked up, resulting in excessive wasted produce</li>
                        <li>Community members want to be able to utilize the community garden, but either don’t feel comfortable or are unaware of the logistics surrounding the garden</li>

                    <p>Following our user personas, we created an in-depth user journey that followed the steps that the user would typically take on a trip to their community garden. We hoped that the mapped out user journey would allow us to see exactly where users felt most stressed as well as what aspects of commynity gardens we could build up upon.</p>

                    <p>At the conclusion of our ideation phase, we ended up with many separate solutions that would allow our users to better utalize their community, and in turn increase their food sustainability.  Our team decided that the next step would to be to create one solution that included all these separated ideas into a cohesive and easy to use design.  We tinkered around with different ideas of physical and digital products and decided that the most feasible designs would be:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>systems redesign</li>

                    </div>

                    <p>The systems redesign of the community garden would put a larger focus on the community aspect of the garden. It would be more than just members picking up produce; the garden would be a hub of activity that excites the community to partake in the gardening.  To execute this, we suggested that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the community managers plan more community events </li>
                        <li>managers spend time highlighting certain community members every week</li>
                        <li>the garden be restructured into a grid based system that streamlines the process of finding produce.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="">
                        <h3><b>Concept App Design</b></h3>
                    </div>

                    <p>A mobile app was the easiest way to implement core features that attended to user needs. A mobile app provides:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>an accessible medium for users to see what produce are available</li>
                        <li>the ability to see what task need to be completed in the garden</li>
                        <li>the capability to provide live time updates on vital information such as
                            <ul>

                    </div>
                    <p>With the overall user flow decided, our team created mid-fidelity prototypes of the main features:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>picking produce</li>
                        <li>event/task scheduler</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Our goal with these midfidelity prototypes was to create a succient user flow that attempted to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>reduce the burden put on the individual with interacting with the app (having to fill our excessive information fields)</li>
                        <li>allowing users to complete their desired tasks in the quickest way possible (by reducing the amount of screens and clicks required to go from”point A to B”)</li>

                    <p>After having non-group members test the prototype and receiving feedback, we realized that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the user flow was too tedious and unintuitive</li>
                        <li>selecting the area on the map before choosing the produce caused confusion and resulted in more of the user’s time being wasted</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <br>

                    <p>With the second iteration, the main flaws were:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the design does not provide a clear indication of the produce status </li>
                        <li>users would have to view the produce main page to see this information</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Our final iteration attempts to fix these issues through the use of a new layout and the implementation of color.</p>

                    <p>This user flow was very poorly received, with some core issues being:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>confusion on how to access tasks and view events</li>
                        <li>a lack of clear indication of things being active or inactive</li>
                        <li>he calendar taking too much space and not providing relevant information</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In our final design, we scrapped the calendar idea and focused on created a succinct task board.</p>
