            <p>Stumbling around the web, I found an interesting Berkeley based service that allows users to find or host co-working spaces within their personal homes.  I found this concept particularly intriguing as it seems very akin to popular services such as Uber or Airbnb, utilizing the internet and the current “gig economy” to allow users to discover new co-working spaces besides local coffee shops, public buildings or their personal homes.  After exploring the site and the product, I was inspired to deconstruct and redesign the Hīven desktop experience.  Additionally, I found the current branding of the site to be interesting and wanted to develop it further.</p>

            <b>The Challenge</b>
          </div>
          <div class="cs-text">
            <p>Hīven is still in a relatively early stage of production, thus the main challenge of design practice was to: </p>
						<br>
						<h4 class="center" id="hiven">Conduct research to understand </h4>
						<br>
						<p>Fill Text</p>
            </div>

    <div class="container">

        <div class="cs-title">
          <b>Research + Insights</b>
        </div>
          <div class="cs-text">
						<p>A core objective of this design practice is to develop an understanding of what users are looking for from Hīven, and to a deeper extent than just “a new co-working space”.  I sought to understand what users wanted and needed from a co-working space, and how [home feeling] differentiation itself from cafés and other work places.  Additionally, I wanted to conduct testing to see how users responded to the current Hīven desktop application and if any UI improvements could be made.  </p>
						<ul>
							<li>surveys — these provided demographic information such as what establishments were most commonly used and what </li>
							<li>user interviews — focusing on how individuals approached finding new work places, and what attracted them to these places</li>
							<li>user testing — of the current Hīven desktop application, followed up by interviews to provide understanding of their pain points and things they enjoy</li>
						</ul>
					
						
						<div class="cs-subtitle" id="hiven">Survey</div>
						<p>In my opinion, the Venmo dashboard is poorly designed in terms of reaching both the company’s goals as well as fulfilling the user’s goals.  The current dashboard is taken up by a social media-esque timeline that a majority of users do not interact with, and pushes the product’s main feature (funds payment and request) into a small icon in the top right corner.</p>
						<img src="images/" class="img-fluid cs-image">
						<p>To better accomplish both the company's and user’s goals the dashboard should:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>encourage users to send a payment or request by implementing a more distinguishable call to action button</li>
							<li>have more relevant information upfront</li>
						</ul>
						<img src="images/" class="img-fluid cs-image">

						<div class="cs-subtitle" id="hiven">User Interviews</div>
						<p>The response I got for user interviews was much smaller than the surveys, and the population could be considered more biased.  To find participants, I first asked my friends and got a somewhat decent response, with 8 people offering their time.  This demographic was interesting because they were primarily students with access to the university’s plethora of libraries; a resource they noted was poor, but was easily accessible and thus was their primary location of working or studying.  The second group of interviewees were a handful of random coffeeshop goers whose coffee I offered to purchase in return for a quick interview.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>difficulty for first time users to find [the pay/request button]</li>
							<li>finding and selecting contacts to pay left user’s feeling uncertain</li>
							<li>the pay/request buttons having no differentiating features, causing users to mistakenly choose the wrong one</li>
						</ul>
						<img src="images/venmo-og-payment.svg" class="img-fluid cs-image">
						
						<p>Additionally, it was pointed out that one of the most frequent use cases for Venmo is for groups to split one large dinner bill.  The current pay flow works fine in this scenario as long as the bill is being divided evenly, but if item prices differ, the Venmo payment flow is very inefficient.  Surprisingly Venmo doesn’t offer any in-app solution to make this user flow easier and as an alternative, may users will download a secondary app that allows them to scan a receipt and calculate the total (including tax and tip) per person.</p>
						<p>When ideating ways to improve the payment user flow, I wanted to address the insights and painpoints that I observed from the quick interviews I did.  Additionally, I wanted to tackle the issues of the user flow as a whole, and not the specific case of bill splitting; although the core pain points addressed were in response to it [bill splitting]. They were the following:</p>
						<div class= "cs-split">
						<ul>
							<li>users occasionally misclick pay instead of request — leading to overdrawn bank accounts
								<ul>
									<li>making the payment or request flows more distinct from each other</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>users find it annoying that they have to fill out the “What is this for” field, often inputting something unrelated or just one quick emoji
								<ul>
									<li>reduce the burden put on required user input fields, by making it optional and having it take less screen space</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>users are frustrated when using Venmo to split a bill (unless everyone has an order of the same amount) because they have to go through the same user flow multiple times
								<ul>
									<li>create seperated cards representing different recipients on the same screen, allowing users to adjust the amount per recipient/</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
