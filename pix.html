                    <p>Pix! is a concept app that <strong>facilitates group decision making and reduces indecision</strong>, allowing for more time to do activities rather than looking for activities.  Imagine roadtripping with a group of friends and being able to easily come to a consensus on what activity you all do.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p><b>Problem</b>: Groups often time have too many options to choose from and are unable to come up with a consensus.  In addition, even if an individual has a recommendation, they feel too much social pressure to actually voice their opinion.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p><b>Solution</b>: Pix! Minimizes the indecision within the group by systematically reducing options and provides an anonymous system for individuals to voice their recommendations.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Pix! started as a group assignment for school, but quickly envolved into a personal endeavor in which I used user ethnography skills such as interviews, personas, user journeys and probes. </p>

                    <h4><b>PRIME OBJECTIVE</b></h4>
                    <p>The primary goal of this app is to provide groups with the ability to reduce the amount of irrelevant suggestions and to quickly come to a consensus. An additional goal is to create an anonymous platform in which individuals can feel comfortable to voice their opinions and not feel the social anxiety that comes with deciding for the whole group.
</p>

                    <p>Pix! isn’t a typical exploration app where you are presented a lengthy list of recommendations and hotspots, but more so it focuses on getting the user(s) to quickly decide on something and spend more time doing and less time searching.</p>

                   <h4><b>Pix! LOGO</b></h4>
                    <p> I've decided on the name 'Pix!'. I chose this name because of it's simple and sounds like the word 'picks'. I chose to go with a pixie/fairy as my product icon because I wanted this app to feel like a guide, or companion that works its ~magic~ to provide a solution. The idea of Pix! was strongly inspired by the pixie guide in Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, as it was based off the pixie that guided Link around. I also think a pixie is a unique visual representation instead of the typical location pin, map, or plane icons, that also added to the whimsical element of the app. </p>

                    <h4><b>THE PROCESS</b></h4>
                    <p>When creating Pix!, I made sure to follow the human-centered design process to ensure that what I was designing addressed a need that my users needed solved, not just what they wanted solved.  The first step in the process was to create a design concept that was broad and addressed a new form of wayfinding.  I, along with some classmates, decided that social traveling was an interesting concept and wanted to explore road trips.  For this project, my group and I followed a pretty standard process of research to ideation to design solution, with <b>our workflow outlined below.</b></p>

                         <p class="text-center descriptiontext">This is a more detailed explaination of our workflow.  We started by choosing our initial design frame and worked that into a broad concept.  Then we did some quick interviews to narrow down our concept and get a better understanding of who we are designing for.  After developing our user groups, we performed indepth interviews and communicated what the main insights we got from them were.</p>

                    <h4 class="subtitle">The Interviews & Insights</h4>
                    <p>The two user group partipants I interviewed were friends of mine whom I know are both avid trip planners and well-versed travellers.  From the observations I made from the interviews, I was able to deduce the insight that <b>people often waste a lot of time on road trips trying to decide what the group should do, and in addition, even if an individual has a suggestion, they are afraid to voice it in fear of the group rejecting it</b>.</p>

                    <h4 class="subtitle">Identifying & Alleviating Pain Points</h4>
                    <p>After we conducted interviews and accumulated insights, we created user journey maps to better understand areas of the road trip experience we could improve.  We were able to to identify two pain points: logistical planning and deciding on nearby exploration.  At this point, my group gave me complete autonomy on the final design solution and did not contribute much more.  I decided that the issue of deciding nearby exploration was an interesting problem to tackle and brainstormed Pix!, a concept app that essential makes a randomized decision for the group based on a ballot system.</p>
