                    <p>Pix! isn’t a typical exploration app where you are presented a lengthy list of recommendations and hotspots, but more so it focuses on getting the user(s) to quickly decide on something and spend more time doing and less time searching.</p>

                   <h4><b>Pix! LOGO</b></h4>
                    <p> I've decided on the name 'Pix!'. I chose this name because of it's simple and sounds like the word 'picks'. I chose to go with a pixie/fairy as my product icon because I wanted this app to feel like a guide, or companion that works its ~magic~ to provide a solution. The idea of Pix! was strongly inspired by the pixie guide in Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, as it was based off the pixie that guided Link around. I also think a pixie is a unique visual representation instead of the typical location pin, map, or plane icons, that also added to the whimsical element of the app. </p> -->

                    <p>Our research revealed that the predominant way people explored in groups was by having a main group leader(s) plan an itinerary, or by having individuals search and explore the area using social media sites such as Yelp! or Instagram.  Using our insights and observations, we created personas to better understand who we are designing for and to better empathize with the our rr statements.  Some of the most impactful insights that we accrued from our research were:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Travelers want to find a balance between a well planned trip that still maintains a feel of spontaneity.</li>

                        <li>Typical tools for discovering new places when traveling often present an overwhelming amount of information, making it difficult to decide on a place.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>When possible, travelers like to consult friends who have previously visited the destination for their recommendations.  Additionally, there seems to be an irrational fear of asking locals for recommendations.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>There is a fear of voicing a suggestion because of the feeling of "choosing for the entire group", and its possible consequences.</li>

                  <!--  <h4><b>THE PROCESS</b></h4>
                    <p>When creating Pix!, I made sure to follow the human-centered design process to ensure that what I was designing addressed a need that my users needed solved, not just what they wanted solved.  The first step in the process was to create a design concept that was broad and addressed a new form of wayfinding.  I, along with some classmates, decided that social traveling was an interesting concept and wanted to explore road trips.  For this project, my group and I followed a pretty standard process of research to ideation to design solution, with <b>our workflow outlined below.</b></p>

                         <p class="text-center descriptiontext">This is a more detailed explaination of our workflow.  We started by choosing our initial design frame and worked that into a broad concept.  Then we did some quick interviews to narrow down our concept and get a better understanding of who we are designing for.  After developing our user groups, we performed indepth interviews and communicated what the main insights we got from them were.</p>

                    <p>The two user group partipants I interviewed were friends of mine whom I know are both avid trip planners and well-versed travellers.  From the observations I made from the interviews, I was able to deduce the insight that <b>people often waste a lot of time on road trips trying to decide what the group should do, and in addition, even if an individual has a suggestion, they are afraid to voice it in fear of the group rejecting it</b>.</p>

                    <p>After we conducted interviews and accumulated insights, we created user journey maps to better understand areas of the road trip experience we could improve.  We were able to to identify two pain points: logistical planning and deciding on nearby exploration.  At this point, my group gave me complete autonomy on the final design solution and did not contribute much more.  I decided that the issue of deciding nearby exploration was an interesting problem to tackle and brainstormed Pix!, a concept app that essential makes a randomized decision for the group based on a ballot system.</p>

                    <p>Pix! is unique because it chooses a winner based on a ballot system rather than a majority takes all system.  For example, if 5 people voted for A, 3 people for B, and 2 person for C; A would have a .5 probablity of being the winner, B would have .3 probablity, and C would have a .2 probablity.  This ballot systems prevents the blame from being put on any person in particular, and encourages people to present their opinions more strongly.</p>

                    <p>User onboarding is the user’s initial experience with your brand and product. It spans from the moment someone starts to sign up for your product, until the moment they realize how your product is going to improve their life. I wanted to ensure that users understand what Loco does, how it will benefit them, and ultimately show them how to use the app. </p>
